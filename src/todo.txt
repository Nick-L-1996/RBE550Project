TODO: 
Add CSV testing
    In GUI
        CSV filename box
        CSV number of runs box
    Need to keep track of:
        Start and End node locations
        Map name associated with the test. I think we'd have to assume you can only do this with a saved map
        Total Runtime
        Total Expansions

Maybe later if we care but not a priority:
Allow early termination of algorithm
